                    <p>
                        Hello fellow traveller! We represent a set of independent users in this
                        new technological frontier. We believe the internet will grow to be a
                        powerful thing, and we don't believe government involvement will be a net
                        positive for its success.

                    <p>TODO: The rest of the argument will go here.</p>
                    <p>Here's what needs to get done:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Complete an argument. Doesn't have to be something you actually believe
                            in, but don't make it obviously flawed. Our argument is that government
                            involvement in the internet will stifle its users' independence.

                            (cool site btw). I think having colorful patterned backgrounds and
                            obnoxious gifs are a good touch here.

                        <li>
                            Make more content to stuff the page with. We'll leave the website to
                            exactly one page, but it'd be cool if there's extra stuff on this page.
                            I've already got a few things here, but there's more to do.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Encurage users to take advantage of the decentralized nature of the internet</li>
                        <li>Don't trust centralized authorities blindly</li>

                        We'll have to avoid merge conflicts of course. Try not to delete this box
                        until stuff's done.
